I have attached a working example to demonstrate where the specific outputs can be found -- however note that for most variables line numbers will be case specific:

Expected Minimum Abundance (EMA): L14 of IntExtRisk.txt (value = 128.4)

Final N of occupied patches (FinalOcc): L66 (4th column) of MetapopOcc.txt (value = 7.8)

Total extinction risk (Ext): L17 (2nd column) of IntExtRisk.txt (value = 0.004) i.e., it is the value where the population threshold = 0 

Quasi extinction risk (QuasiExt): To get this value you need to read the threshold level from line 12 of QuasiExt.txt (i.e. "Time to quasi-extinction (Threshold level = 80.0)"). This threshold is then applied to the file IntExtRisk.txt to calculate Quasi extinction risk i.e., at Line 97 the threshold is 80 returning a probability of 0.2230
Damien added 22/11/2013: I do not think it is calculating quasi extinction risk correctly; and there are instances where extinction risk is calculated as >0 when it should be zero. Regarding the former it should be calculated using the the threshold and probability value in the IntExtRisk.txt file. When calculating extinction risk be mindful that the the first abundance threshold value can be > 0, in these instances extinction risk should equal 0.

Final N of persistent runs (FinalN): First read mean final N from L66 of Abund.txt. Then use the formula: mean Final N/ (1-total extinction risk)

\SensitivityAnalysisToolset\v2.0\Test\MpLoadResultsTest\BatchComplete\BatchComplete:

Expected Minimum Abundance
0001: 81.1
0002: 123.3
0003: 128.3

Final N of occupied patches
0001: 7.1
0002: 7.8
0003: 7.9

Total extinction risk
0001: 0.0330
0002: 0.0030
0003: 0.0060

Quasi extinction risk
0001: (th = 80) 0.5450
0002: (th = 80) 0.2530
0003: (th = 80) 0.2340

Final N of persistent runs
0001: 365.59/(1-0.0330) = 378.07
0002: 923.76/(1-0.0030) = 926.54
0003: 1043.53/(1-0.0060) = 1049.83
