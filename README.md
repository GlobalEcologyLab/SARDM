# SARDM
The Sensitivity Analysis of Range Dynamics Models (SARDM) software tool generates modelling tool input files having parameters randomly distributed via selected distributions. Although initially configured for a specific modelling tool, it could potentially be further developed and configured for performing sensitivity analysis on a range of modelling software.
